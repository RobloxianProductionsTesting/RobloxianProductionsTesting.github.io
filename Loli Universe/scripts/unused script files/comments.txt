Maybe some public scenes in the park? I don't think there's any content there right now.

i would be very appreciated if the game developer makes more trap content

Some good old public sex/humiliation for inhibited characters would be great, Sam White in particular. I mean, it was easier to break a local delinquient than it was to break Sam. So how about a few following scenes where the little trap is forced to go to school in female uniform or even suck off his bullies in the school locker room? I am definitely not waiting for the Perverted Education type of story from a corruptor's perspective.


When you say you tent to write longer scenes - do you mean bigger descriptions or just longer scenes overall? Because if you guys could be a little more detailed in your erotic descriptions between all the dialogue that would be fantastic.


Edit_Mid_Writing: Yay, more people getting on the trap train!


You need to

- Go to the SAVE/LOAD section and there find and press "Save to text string"

- Copy the code. Create a new .txt file on your desktop. Paste the code it the .txt file

- Should be easy to edit money/skills. You don't really need to edit anything else. Save changes and copy the new code. Not the file, just code

- Go to SAVE/LOAD again, press "load from text string", paste the new code.


Congrats, you're set. Have fun, ya dirty cheater.

This was hotter than I expected it to be. Good work!

Very nice. It would be good to have some non-story repeatable scenes, galleries just aren't the same. But what there is is very hot.

[SPOILER="All the girls"]

Emily: Very sexy, looks great in that bikini. Not a huge fan of the unshaved thing though; a bush is fine, but those armpits are a bit nasty.


Steph: Smoking hot, an evil hypnotist with lots of women under his control shouldn't really be paying for handjobs, but it's worth it to get close enough to make her his. Hope once he has his hands on her that unenthusiastic thing of hers will change to very enthusiastic and loud. I like the slutty friend getting off listening to her work over the phone too, that's a fun detail.


Sam: Pretty unsubtle with the whole 'I am an evil hypnotist and you are my slave' thing. Interesting to be on the other side of that though; pretty much every other game I've seen has the player playing as the sissy. Also like trappy little things getting their prostates played with, so that's a plus.


Mary: Like her a lot, the devoted servant enthusiastic to help her master recruit others thing is very hot.


Margaret: I really like the way she's clearly still Mary's mother, giving her the guidance a mother should, but twisted. Much prefer that kind of thing to the completely blank zombie-girl archetype.


Lena: She's hot when she lets herself relax, looking forward to seeing more of her with her employer.


Anna: Only one scene for her so far, but what a scene! Amazingly hot. Definitely want to see more of her.


Reese: Looks really good in the girls' uniform. Not quite so much in the leotard, it's not femmy enough for my taste. In the right outfit though I might actually prefer him to the 'real' girls.


Victoria: No scenes yet, so can't really judge how she's going to be, but she's hot and I like her outfit a lot.


Lisa: Similar to Victoria, very pretty and I like the conservative-sexy style, but no genre hints make it hard to guess how much I'll like her story.


Casandra: Don't really know what to make of her. Supposedly a skilled hypnotist, but her idea of a good reaction give her sister to a guy trying to hypnotise her is to kill him there and then? She may be even less subtle than our hero. Having a minion who is herself a hypnotist is a nice idea, hope it goes that way. And if she's got bored with being in charge, offering her the chance to try something different could be a good 'in'. Maybe she'll turn out to prefer being a lieutenant rather than a mistress?


Emma: Cute, but we know even less about her than any of the other girls.
